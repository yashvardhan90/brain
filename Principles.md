#### What are my standards for myself?

- That I am always honest - especially with myself
- that I push myself harder than anyone I know
- that I don't need other people to recognize or even see it
- I do it because I like how it makes me feel about myself
- pursue GREATNESS.
- do what I believe is right - not what appears right to other people
- I don't need excuses or explanations for who I am, what I do, or what I want 
- deeply care about people - nurture the important relationships 
- spend time with people I like being around. (Seems so obvious)
- say no to things that get in the way of my goals 
- eat food that is good for me - mentally, physically, spiritually 
- I grow and evolve faster than anyone I know
- bias towards action
- show up fully with energy every day
- I actually learn rather than surface level understanding
- do hard things. Fewer things but hard things. And important things.
- question everything. Be open.

#### Principles

- Donâ€™t make the same mistake twice.
- Be critical of your work, always be dissatisfied. Drive to make things better.
- It's your job to make the code reviewable; add comments; never repeat code;
- Your work speaks for yourself; never get laziness define your work; don't publish PR till you're 100% sure it is perfect.
- Never let your brand suffer. Focus on getting it right always.
- To understand what is expected, try to put yourself in their shoes.
- Always try to understand things in deep, else you have no weight to your voice and your brand suffers.

#### Learnings

- Smart people **challenge the assumptions** behind the idea, not the implementation on how to do it.
